## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a great reinforcer for applying design a design system before working on the page. It was probably too small of a project for a design system but I wanted practice.

### Continued development

I'd definitely like to streamline my sass after getting feedback
